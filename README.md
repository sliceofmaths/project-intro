# project-intro
Hi to everyone and welcome to Slice of Maths!

My name is Andr√©s, I'm from Spain and I am studying maths at the Universidad Complutense of Madrid.

I am going to use this website to upload theory (with demonstrations, as possible as I can) and applications of mathematics.
The main goal of this project is we all learn about the topics explained here by reading the content (and improve it if it is not 
correct or totally accurate) and comments, or just giving ideas.

Hope we have fan!

PD: I am new at Github, so it's hard for me to do anything here right now. Anyway I'll do my best!
